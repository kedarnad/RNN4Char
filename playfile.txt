the ships clock bonged drowsily three times bud chandler the junior watch glared at it languidly thus he yawned endeth the lobster patrol three bells my fine buckoand the soft warm hay for you or there was a hopeful note in his voice or would you like to finish out my trick for me ill stand double for you some night dan mallory said comets to you sailor and he rose stretching the kinks out of weary muscles his collar was open at the throat his back ached from five solid hours in the bucketshaped control chair his eyes were strained that was from peering alternately at glowing panels through a perilens plate into the murky blueblack space before the voidhurtling libra and back to the panels again theres a little thing called sleep which im going to grab some of as soon as norton shows up where the pink cepheids tell you what finish my trick tonight dan and ill double for you twice thats fair enough isnt it fair enough said mallory but not sufficiently enticing like an albino on a desert planetoid ah heres our hero now welcome sir relief dump it into the basket and let poppa go seek the arms of morpheus whos she growled rick norton third mate his eyes were puffy he squinted and glared at the bright lights of the control turret hells howling acres im tired i just about got to sleep whenoh well log in order directly mallory shot a curious glance at norton just got to sleep how come what were you doing up so late it wasnt official business answered the junior officer curtly so its none of yours lets have your log sheet he slumped into the control chair squinted through the perilens and made a few tiny course corrections across the room bud chandlers shoulders shrugged a reply to dans swift lift of the eyebrows the second mates lips formed a word sorehead mallory nodded norton was a surly sonofaspacewrangler but that wasnt any skin off his nose he went to the chart table footsteps clattered up the jacobs ladder the door flew open and the old man stomped onto the bridge he snapped zuwere and glowered over mallorys shoulder shrewd spacefaded eyes reading sense into the senior lieutenants neat precise columns he jabbed a horny finger at one line of figures sure o that mallory velocity that high mallory said respectfully yes sir all figures have been checked and double checked were point ohohone on course forced speed point thirtynine above normal checked and double checked said captain algase is good enough most of the time but this trip is special and vitally important forty thousand innocent lives depend on our reaching io damn soon remember that mallory all of you remember that the stern lines of his face eased a trifle its been a hard shuttle i know a brutal punishing trip and weve all been under a terrific strain but our difficulties are nothing compared to those of the garrison and the honest colonists of new fresno theyre looking to us for aid and were bringing them aid that is someone aboard this ship is i honestly dont know who that person is no one knows except the man himself the commander of the ssp intelligence department on earth and maybe someone at new fresno but he is on board either an officer sailor or passenger and he is carrying to io the plans for the new ray weapon recently perfected by the ssp ordnance bureau those plans will enable our new fresno garrison to subdue this mysterious uprising on io thats why the libra is traveling at forced speed thats why we must redouble every normal precaution to insure our reaching the io colony thats why too we must keep our eyes open watch even each other whats the matter with you norton      norton had started suddenly now he muttered redfaced sorry sir sudden light in the visiplate it looked like a meteoride theres nothing there now said the skipper but chandler repeated watch each other captain i dont get it were all pledged and trusted members of the solar space patrol arent we we all live by the ssp motto i dont see he fingered his breast insignia that tiny golden rocket emblazoned with the words order out of chaos i dont see why we should because explained the skipper grimly wherever theres an uprising there are converts to the new cause traitors to the old where there are plans there are spies to steal them thats not a warning from hq thats plain oldfashioned horsesense i fought through the rollie rebellion you know after the grantland massacre i discovered that one of my own messmates was in the pay of the mercurians i wont say for sure that there is a spy aboard the libra but if there is we must give him no opportunity to learn anything weary or not we must remain on the alert at all times but i neednt say any more finished mallory yes sir log in order sir very good you may retire chandler you seem to be fagged bud said one more yawn and ill be a zombie a gabby zombie sniffed the old man ill finish your trick for you go get some rest still glowering he plumped himself into the seat vacated by chandler cut in the intercommunications board audioed the radio turret is that you sparks wake up you lazy scut any news from the earth or mars central the radiomans voice clacked metallically no sir i cant get through to any station the rebel forces at new fresno are still jamming the ether with static interference on all wave bands well keep trying let me know if you get through well the skipper glanced back over his shoulder well i thought you two were tired what are you waiting for want to stand another trick apiece no sir said both men hastily were leaving sir they fled aint he a whipper though asked chandler affectionately he growls like a terrier pup but hes got no more bite than a cup custard scuse me a gigantic yawn split his grin in two must have been something i et the hell of it is said mallory ruefully now im off duty im not a bit tired i wasnt tired at all really just had hardening of the panties from squatting in that seat so long got a cigarette chandler tossed him a package and dont swipe the coupon either six thousand more and i get an electronic microscope well you can do what you like im going byebye and try to forget the waffles that bucketseat has pressed into my hip pockets night pal his footsteps rang sharp little echoes on the metal flooring echoes that hollowed as he disappeared down a corridor leading to the sleeping quarters and mallory turned toward the observation deck the tall first mate leaned against the heavy quartzite pane staring into the depths of space through which the libra scudded the sight was no novelty to him but as ever it wakened in his heart a sense of awe a feeling of weird instability a sort of pride in man that he of all the many strange lifeforms experimenting nature had devised should so far be the only one whose imagination was so great whose curiosity was so strong that he had found a way to fling himself at blinding speed across the broad unfathomable reaches of the void it was disheartening to realize that even though he had attained the stars man had not yet sloughed off the instincts and habits of the ape from which he sprang mans genius had blazed a path across the spaceways mans bravery had established new colonies from scorching mercury to frozen uranus ssp lightships bridged the chasms between and beyond even now the concentrated rays of faraway sol were steaming the rimy crust off pluto that earths miners might extract the valuable ores revealed by the spectroscope but with the growth of the colonies mans ever latent cupidity had come into play this past half century thought dan mallory with a sort of savage anger had been nothing but one long bloody era of warfare between the forces of law and the outlawry of the greedy now there was this uprising on the first satellite of jupiter io a charming little world a pleasant earthlike orb spinning quietly about its gigantic parent up to this time its natives had never been troublesome squat muscular creatures more or less anthropoid except for the fact that their complexions had a pale greenish cast and their eyes were doublelidded like those of snakes they had an intelligence of 63 on the solar constant scale within a century or so the control board meant to award them autonomy toward this end educators had been working ever since io had been removed from the british imperial protectorate in 2221 trouble had sprung both literally and figuratively like a bolt from the blue a cosmic blitzkrieg one moment there had been peace and sweet content on io the next came a frantic garbled message about a rebel army  natives  led by the rest had been drowned in an eardrum blasting burst of electronic static that had rendered all further communication impossible kreuther said mallory thoughtfully the affair sounded like one of kreuthers moves that powermad genius exiled from earth after the thwarted lunar campaign of 2234 was accustomed to strike in just this fashion he alone of all avowed ssp enemies had the persuasive ability to win to his cause a horde of normally contented ionians the wealth with which to set into motion wars red machinery the genius with which to disrupt interplanetary communications but if it is kreuther thought mallory consolingly this time hes bitten off more than he can chew that new weapon he wondered briefly which officer sailor passenger had been entrusted with the secret of the new ray guns construction then he cast the thought from his mind it was none of his business it were better he didnt know it was at that stage of his reverie that a sudden byplay of movement captured his attention in an instant he had cupped his cigarette into his palm stepped into a dark patch of shadow a figure had glided from the passageway that led to the sleeping quarters was now peering uncertainly into the observation deck it was david wilmot one of the six passengers aboard the libra wilmots thin face was pinched with nervousness he coughed a thin little hacking sound in the muted quiet then put the back of his hand to his mouth dan stood motionless his dark uniform blending perfectly with the drapes that concealed him as he waited watching the door at the far end of the deck opened a short plump man in nightrobe entered wilmot sprang forward eagerly his whisper carried to dans keen ears have you got them doctor quiet you fool dr bonettis forehead creased angrily his eyeglasses reflected a subdued light owlishly he fumbled in his pocket passed something white to the other man here but not a word about this mind you i know i know wilmot seized the papers avidly turned and fled down the corridor whence he had emerged the doctor stared after him for a moment shook his head regretfully then disappeared the door closed behind him softly thats why too we must keep our eyes open the skippers words echoed in dan mallorys memory as he stepped from his hiding place brow furrowed what the devil was going on here could bonetti have been the bearer of the secret plans could wilmot have been the spy had he just witnessed the sellout of a traitor but before he could get his jumbled thoughts into order a voice addressed him from behind gravely quietly rather confusing eh lieutenant dan whirled to look into the face of garland smith another of the libras passengers he said half pettishly you captain what are you doing up at this time of night      the onetime officer of the ssp now on the retired list shot a swift glance at the glittering panorama visible through the quartzite plates night lieutenant night and day are nothing but quirks of speech out here sleep a matter of habit when you have lifted gravs as many years as i have he sighed i was restless and perhaps it is just as well i witnessed the same thing you did and strange things are going on aboard the libra mallory said cautiously perhaps youre too apprehensive captain just because two passengers are sleepless like yourself meet in the observation chamber theyre not the only two who are still awake the whole slumbering ship stirs with movement my boy a moment or so before you arrived i saw albert lemming stealing down the no 2 corridorand stealing is the only word that describes his progress before that mrs wilmot had a secret rendezvous with some one in the smoking room i dont know who her companion was and lady alice has not been in her cabin all night the older mans eyes sought mallorys his gaze was piercing my boy i realize that i no longer rank you but not so long ago i was your senior once a patrolman always a patrolman you know i feel we are in the midst of an intrigue too weighty for one man to solve perhaps the experience of an old officer may help tell me is it true what i have heard that someone aboard this vessel is carrying to the new fresno garrison the secret of earths new ray weapon if so the mysterious actions weve witnessed may be espionage agents of the kreuther forces mallory said respectfully im very sorry sir i am not permitted to say anything but i would suggest that in the morning you speak to captain algase im sure hell welcome your offer of assistance his face clouded slowly he said lady alice where did you see her last in the reading room mallory saluted turned and went to the ships library as he walked he found himself hoping why he did not try to explain to himself that he would find the room empty but it was not a single lamp was lighted inside as mallory pressed open the door shadows danced on the farther wall the wavering unidimensional symbol of an upright figure spun and made swift jabbing motions dropped there was a sound of paper rustling the rough scrape of calfskin on buckram then he was in the room and lady alice was seated beside the refectory table ostensibly reading a book she glanced up with a little movement of surprise why lieutenant what a pleasant surprise mallory stifled the impulse to say pleasant he stared at the girl curiously reminding himself for the hundredth time since she had come aboard this ship six days ago that as man and woman they had no common meeting ground they lived on planes inordinately diverse he was dan mallory a lieutenant of the solar space patrol a respectable if underpaid watchdog of law and order in mans widening circle of influence moreover he was a young lieutenant it would be years before he earned a major brevet became an acceptable social figure even if a miracle were to happen if he were to be selected into the envied corps of lensmen he would only be a supercop while she she was lady alice charwell possessor of a name and title respected for more than eight hundred years of course the title was now one of courtesy only there was no duchy of io since the cession of that satellite to the world council but once her father had been manor lord of the entire globe in the almanach de gotha her family name and crest still figured prominently all of which had little to do with the fact that her eyes were blue as the morning mists of venus that her limbs were white and straight and supple softly feminine despite the mannish slack and shirt ensemble she affected that her hair was a seine of sunlight gold that snared dan mallorys heart and quickened his breath he forced his voice to calmness he said lady alice dont you think it would be better if you were to go to bed thisthis staying up at night her laughter was warm and delicious but lieutenant surely theres no harm in my reading myself to sleep not a bit agreed mallory he bit his lip i might suggest though that unless youre reading a book in the lower venusian language it would be easier to read if the book were right side up and he walked past her swiftly stared at the book which hastily thrust back into the bookcase still jutted out beyond its fellows and you might find more interesting reading matter than a tactical survey of ionian military resources the girls face was scarlet she came to her feet indignantly really lieutenant you go too far i dont see that it is any of your business lady alice said mallory pleadingly a state of war exists on io strange things are happening aboard the libra things the exact nature of which i am not at liberty to explain if you will try to forget for a moment that i am a space officerjust think of me as a manwill you allow me to make the suggestion that you do absolutely nothing to lay your actions your motives open to any sort of suspicion i realize that as one who inherited a claim to the title duchess of io you are deeply interested in current affairs on that colony others may read another meaning into your actions though at least one person has already hinted that you lady alices breathing was swift who she demanded who is this person im sorry i cant say but will you do as i suggest there was a moment of silence then the girl shut the book on her lap laid it on the table rose very well lieutenant im a rather poor deceiver arent i nevertheless i thank you for your wellmeant advice she moved toward the doorway grace and poise in her every stride and she turned there to smile back at him her voice soft and unamused lieutenant she said you should lay aside your shoulderstraps more often the man beneath is mostinteresting then she was gone leaving behind her a redfaced speechless utterly chaotic dan mallory      at breakfast mallory presided at the head of the table bud chandler arriving a few minutes late stared at his comrade surprisedly why skipper he said what this trip is doing for your complexion you look thirty years younger where did you get them pretty pink cheeks mallory growled sit down pal and shut up the old mans grabbing forty and he deserves em he and norton ran into a loftbound vacuole last night had a hell of a time pulling out didnt you hear the commotion all i heard complained bud was somebody in my room snoring it woke me up once and what made me maddest was when i found out it was me he nodded to the assembled passengers sat down and made wry faces over his grapefruit juice albert lemming the swarthyskinned jewel merchant en route to his companys headquarters in new fresno stared at the actingcaptain curiously a vacuole lieutenant whats that a hole in space something like an airpocket in the ether they arent particularly dangerous but the one we ran into was whirling in the wrong direction if captain algase hadnt pulled us out wed have lost time on our trip to io mrs wilmot looked up she was not thought mallory a bad looking dameif you went for that sharp peaked sort of beauty but there was a touch of cruelty to the cut of her lips a pinched look about the nostrils he didnt go for and her eyes were too close together she said that would be unfortunate wouldnt it lieutenant losing time i mean there was a touch of some subtler meaning behind her words mallory couldnt decide just what it was maybe it was sarcasm maybe it was fear maybe it was mockery he said i think we all share the desire to reach new fresno as soon as possible dont we her answer was unexpectedly sharp i dont care if we never reach there id rather die peacefully in space than susan her husbands voice sheared the end of the sentence into silence her eyes glared defiance at him for a moment then she returned to the business of eating lemming looked embarrassed dr bonetti shook his head captain smith coughed suggested mildly captain algase must be an excellent astronavigator lieutenant i didnt notice a single jarring motion in my day escape from a vacuole was a tedious shipwracking process of course his eyes wandered about the table querulously of course there are so many new inventions nowadays improvements in all lines spacecraft airmodifiers armament mallory rose suddenly he was half angry with the exspace officer smith wasnt being very subtle in his effort to help matters no doubt the old duck meant well but he said if youll excuse me ladies and gentlemen i must go to the bridge ready bud bud chandler gulped ssswllwmcffy ulp what i said as soon as i swallow my coffee repeated the second mate aggrievedly cant you understand english lets go lemming intercepted them as they passed his end of the table he asked lieutenant ive been wanting to ask for several daysmight i be permitted to visit the bridge this is my first spaceflight you know ive always wanted to see how the controls are operated speak to captain algase suggested dan thats not within my poweryes billy the messboy had just raced in from the outer deck trayless almost breathless yre wanted on the bridge immejitely lootenant capn orders his eyes were as big as saucers sparks just got a message through a message from new fresno dan had just time to notice out of the corner of one eye how this bald pronouncement affected the passengers he saw the concerted motion that dragged them all to their feet as if they were puppets on a single string saw the sudden gleam in wilmots eye the worried frown that creased bonettis forehead heard the swift startled gasp from lady alice and intercepted captain smiths darting glances from one to another of the listeners lemmings voice quavered aa message from new fresno and susan wilmot laughed a short strident triumphant burst of sound then dan mallory saw no more for with chandler at his heels he was pounding through the corridors to the jacobs ladder that fed the control turret      captain algase was no beauty even when garbed in his officers blues in pajamas and slippers he was something out of a nightmare his bare legs were like cylindrical hair mattresses his pajama slacks bulged at the equator as if he were concealing there a half watermelon his eyes were red and gummy his temper like something that could be poured out of a cruet as dan and bud entered the control turret he was battering the bewildered radiomans defenses into oblivion with a salvo of verbal thermite message he was howling you call this thing a message ill have you stewed in slow gravy for waking me up like this sparks of all the damn dumb he saw his two lieutenants never mind you two go back and finish your breakfast false alarm weve finished skipper said dan whats all the commotion this oeoe09 began algase sparks said miserably but it was marlowes hand on the keys capn i swear it was i know the message dont make sense but you cant fool a bugpounder every radioman has a distinctive sending style ask anybody even one of them wisecracking donovan boys theyll tell you and this was marlowes hand lets see said mallory he took the flimsy from his seniors fingers frowned as he ran an eye over the cryptic symbols numerals all numerals sparks it was like this the static interference is still going on the audio wouldnt bring in voice at all but as i was twisting the dials i got this power wave from lunar iii joe marlowes station it had aa sort of cadence i began putting down the things it sounded like andand thats what come out chandler peering over his comrades shoulder said well hells bells are you all nuts it must be a code of some sort sparks we use several numerical codes dont we yes meekly but that aint one of them lieutenant that dont fit no code in the reg book mallory continued to stare at the message it was long and undeniably confusing it read 83715223212167643102161841676490211269214427 18631509516175479161400840023994450951730419 161025698714008161842321218631399441276114008

but what good is a code when we aint got the key to it it aint a simple word substitution cryptogram or a fivebyfive i studied them in the academy and tried them all before i brought this to the captain in other words it aint no good to us unless weve got the clueand we aint got the clue      mallory said billy said this was a message from new fresno well he was wrong as usual determinedly it come from earths moon i know joe marlowes fingers when i hear em damn we was classmates for three years before i got crazy and gave up chemistry for keypushing chemistry mallory started did you say chemistry did you and marlowe study chemistry together yeah why why because thats the answer marlowe is nobodys fool he knew you were the radioman aboard the libra prepared a special code the key to which would lie in your brain as the memory of auld lang synebud look at these figures again you notice the number 16 appearing over and over even in that thick skull of yours 16 suggests oxygen declared chandler promptly the atomic weight of oxygen and eightythree point seven fortyseven nine krypton andlets seetitanium right grab a pencil pal i think weve got a solution here jot these downkrypton europium thorium erbiumhold it he looked at his companion disgustedly just the symbols you dope dont you see the symbols of the various elements employ every letter in the english language except j and qand those are the two least commonly used anyway start over krypton kr said bud europium eu thorium erbium kreuther howled bud thats it dan keep going      the message slowly scrawled its way onto paper a word appeared another another then ten point twentyfive said mallory followed by 6987 what the hell are they bud said maybe he made a mistake borons 1082 lithiums 694 no thats not it said mallory he frowned captain algase had long since wakened completely was listening to his two juniors with glowing pride now he cut the gordian knot chromium he suggested is fiftytwo point one dan the reverse of the number that stumps you right thats it skipper and the meaning must be that the symbol is to be written in reverse rc instead of cr there arent enough combinations to spell every word in the language unless you use some subterfuges like that which makes the word said bud forces go on pal mallory plunged into the heart of the coded letter 39944 argon said bud a 11476 indium 15043 samarium sa next iodine i the message was finished bud handed it to captain algase mallorys curiosity was at fever pitch he had not been able to piece the letters together as he went along he had gained but a smattering here and there he waited the skipper read slowly breaking the message up into coherent sentences kreuther power behind revolution heavy forces now threatening new fresno kreuther huh growled bud i thought so hasten assistance lane warns the captain stopped stared a moment glanced swiftly at mallory there was a tight note in his voice lane warns lady alice cabal spy now in libra lady alice blurted mallory the warmth of the control turret suddenly weighed down upon him his brow felt hot oppressed as if some gigantic hand had descended upon his temples captain saith continued algase intensify protection of new secret ray he crumpled the paper and that is all gentlemen mallory yes sir our fears were justified there is a spy on the libra we must take no chances you will arrest lady alice charwell place her under lock and key for the duration of the voyage bud chandler muttered where does marlowe get that old english stuff saith why didnt he say says because mallory answered mechanically there is no ys combination in the elemental vocabulary he had to say it that way the recollection of his unpleasant duty flooded back on him with it came protest but it cant be true captain there must be some mistake surely lady alice wouldnt be on the contrary daniel algases voice was unusually gentle she would be once her family owned all of io it is more than likely that she should want to see the globe freed of board control regain her lost property she could well be in league with kreuther to overthrow the present government according to this she is yes sir acknowledged dan dully he was thinking of captain smiths warning of the book lady alice had been reading the book on military tactics shall i make thethe arrest now sir yes lieutenant very good sir he turned and left the room his jaw was white and rigid a dull hurt was behind his eyes      a strained assemblage awaited his return to the mess hall as he entered the room all conversation ended abruptly an almost audible silence fell upon the group of passengers lemming half rose from his seat opened his mouth as though to say something closed it again his lips a white slit against the green pallor of his cheeks lady alices eyes were tense expectant captain smith moved forward to meet him the exspace officers heavy frame was poised and ready there was a note of subdued eagerness in his voice he said stridently well lieutenant dan mallorys patience with the older man was quite exhausted he said curtly but in a voice that did not reach the ears of the others captain i must remind you that you have no authority whatsoever on this ship i appreciate your willingness to help but angrily for gods sake man stop acting like the hero of a twentysecond century dime novel stop fingering your needlegun and smith looked embarrassed his heavy shoulders sagged and swift contrition swept over mallory as the onetime officer said iim sorry lieutenant lemming had found words at last he asked shakily thethe message lieutenant was it he had to arrest lady alice thought dan mallory but he didnt have to humiliate her to brand her eternally as a traitor in the eyes of her associates and he still held doggedly to the hope that somehow somewhere had been made a dreadful mistake he said the message was a routine transmission mr lemming of no great importance now will you all be kind enough to disband quietly no one moved mallory glancing at the faces about him felt again that conviction that an interwoven webbing of intrigue entangled these passengers he said firmly that is not a request but a command you will all retire to the observation deck at once the little group stirred mallory sought the side of lady alice said ive been wanting to show you the ship lady alice wouldnt you like to see it now her look of pleased surprise burned him she said why lieutenant how nice i would enjoy it they moved in a direction opposite that of the rest of the passengers even so they did not escape unnoticed from the corner of his eye dan mallory caught the glitter of dr bonettis spectacles realized that the dumpy man was watching them shrewdly and for a moment his eye met that of captain garland smith the old officers head was nodding in mused speculation he too had guessed mallorys concealed purpose only the girl herself seemed unaware that this was not merely a pleasantry her shoulder brushed that of mallory as they pressed through a narrow doorway the soft feminine warmth of her heaped reproach on the young lieutenant as did her words lieutenant i see you can take advice as well as give it i had no idea last night when i suggested that you reveal the man beneath the uniform more often that you would actually they were alone now and mallory turned to face her his voice purposely hard and impersonal if you please lady alice it is my painful duty to inform you that you are under arrest under ar her gasp ended in a burst of light laughter she brought her hand to her forehead in mock salute aye lieutenant brig ho but if im not too inquisitive what charges are preferred against me murder of course i do kill time most horribly but these long tripsor could it be theft im sure ive stolen nothing unless you mean she paused in sudden confusion her eyes lifted to his there was something written there something breathtaking mallory had to hold tight the charge he said tersely istreason that message was from lunar iii lady alice it bore a warning from the commander of the intelligence division there advising us that you had been discovered to be a member of igor kreuthers organization      the light died from the girls eyes the smile on her lips turned to ice her slim body stiffened straightened and for an instant dan mallory saw with swift prescience that this girl was not all charm and allure that beneath her tempting softness there was a core steelstrong of strength and daring treason treason youyou blind fool she spat you dare accuse me lady alice charwell grand duchess of io lady of the rocket and globe maid of the golden crest ofof treason sir my family ruled io when that dominion was first discovered for almost three hundred years the charwell crest has please lady alice pleaded mallory i know how you feel about it to your mind your actions were not treasonable but io is no longer yours it is under the guardianship of the control board and you mustnt talk this way i will be called to testify against you anything you say will be convicting evidence he touched her shoulder as though the warmth of his hand might melt its icy stiffness she shrugged herself loose disdainfully i think we can dispense with the amenities lieutenant the smile on the lips  the gracious invitation to see the ship  the friendly hand of comfort there was scorn anger pain in her eyes it is my right to demand the privilege of communicating with my accusers is it not those on earth who im sorry no audio transmission is possible because of the blanketstatic the message came through in a code i see i must wait then until we reach new fresno never mind lieutenant mallory you have said enough i presume you are placing me under guard wherein my own quarters very well if you will be kind enough to escort me there she laughed brittlely but of course you will you couldnt let a traitor out of your sight could you in throbbing bitter silence they moved down the corridors to lady alices stateroom there she spoke for the last time the message that accused me lieutenant might i be permitted to hear the damning evidence what did it say there was no harm thought mallory miserably in telling her that the words were like acid etched into his brain he repeated them she listened intently frownedand then a new curious look stole into her eyes she said but yes said mallory yes the look faded she laughed scornfully hoping to hear more convicting evidence lieutenant im so sorry to disappoint you now will you lock the door after me please dan mallory made a last try it would cost him his rocket if anyone heard his words but lady alice he pleaded im honestly sorry about this i dont believe you are guilty if youll trust me tell me your side of the story ill do everything in my power to you have done said the girl tightly more than enough right now guard me well lieutenant with a short mocking laugh she slipped through the door mallory waited a long minute then turned the key in the lock its grate was a taunting sneer he returned to the bridge      he couldnt help overhearing the end of that conversation the runway that fed the control turret was narrow and metalwalled it formed a perfect soundbox moreover the door was ajar the voice was captain algase reached his ears perfectly as he approached the room dont want to have to remind you again norton that it is highly unethical for a space officer to become involved with a woman passenger especially with a married woman and the surly voice of third mate rick norton saying very well sir then footsteps approaching the door a figure confronting his squarely norton flushing snarling getting an earful mallory dan was in no mood for bickering he said dont mind me norton ive known for months you were a skirtchaser i dont consider it any of my business nortons cheeks flamed he said insultingly and i suppose you stand behind your stripes as you say that forget the stripes mallory looked at his fists i stand behind these good norton swung he was a wellbuilt man a strong man his blow packed dynamitebut it needed a target to set off the percussion cap it found no target but a moving one mallory ducked rolled with the punch came up inside the third mates guard to land a short jabbing left to the midsection a blasting right to the point of nortons jaw norton gasped and collapsed soggily arms behind him reached out to support his falling weight other lips behind mallory whistled softly as bud chandler coming up to serve his trick witnessed the swift decisive exchange of blows and captain algase releasing nortons inert form glared at mallory well well lieutenant i think you know we have rules against brawling aye sir but captain algase stroked his jaw speculatively in this casechandler get him below it served him right maybe hell spend this rest period sleeping instead of stirring up trouble amongst the passengers dan my boy he led the way back into the turret completed the log record for the previous trick handed it to mallory who had slipped into the control bucket twentyfour more earth hours and well be there he said and believe me ill be glad when this trip ends trouble nothing but trouble from beginning to end long tricks and short tempers norton getting mixed up with that wilmot damea damn hussy if i ever saw one and her husband a neurotic wreck smith bothering the blistering hades out of me wanting to help catch spies and a thousand other he glanced at mallory who had stiffened at the word his glance was sympathetic im sorry i had to ask you to arrest her daniel but its experiences like that that make strong men out of space officers you have to be hard in this business crime hides beneath strange disguises the sweetest smiles the friendliest handshakes the most honeyed words may conceal if you please sir said dan mallory whitelipped i know lad ive seen the way you looked at her but rememberforty thousand innocent lives had she learned the secret of that new weapon our voyage might have been disastrous from this distance she could have made a flight to io in one of the auxiliary safety rockets given the plans to kreuthers forces the very weapon we look to for salvation would have been used against us io might have become a nest of rebellion instead of a peaceful member of the solar family now that weve snared our spy the messengerwhoever he iswill be safe on the visiplate it was a glowing red spark but in the perilens before him it was a gigantic orb dominating the heavens through which the libra hurtled jupiter monster of sols scattered brood untamed sphere of writhing gases and vague mystery itself a pseudoparent emanating enough heat to make its farflung satellites livable worlds soon they would fling themselves they aboard the libra halfway around that gigantic orb settle to the small body now wanly visible as a silver crescent      dan mallory punched a controlkey savagely felt the libra shake itself into a slightly changed curve turned to his superior im not so sure of that sir oh im not trying to defend lady alice earths intelligence officers dont make mistakesnot mistakes of that magnitude anyway but there are other passengers i dont trust lemming wilmot dr bonetti why are they aboard the libra why were they so excited when they heard wed received a message from lunar iii suppose one of them is also a spy or suppose said the skipper one of them bears the secret of the new ray weapon wouldnt that one naturally be excited but the others mallory inquired i dont know you may have something there daniel im still taking no chances ive put aiken on guard at lady alices door if anyone tries to liberate herwhat is it sparks he snapped the query at the intercommunications box which was spluttering and growling the radiomans tone was weary its mr wilmot again sir he insists on talking to you tell mr wilmot i will see him at midday mess sparks was stubborn about it but he insists his message is important sir he demands to see you at once says demands the skippers jowls reddened please tell mr wilmot passengers do not demand favors of spaceship officers i will see him at mess that is all and he cut the communications board turned to mallory angrily thats why i didnt put you on report for slugging norton wilmots mad as a hornet and i dont blame him norton catting around after his wife chandler appeared grinning he said to mallory what a sock pal what a sock if that guy counts sheep in his sleep hes going to wake up allergic to mutton wish i had done it hes a grouchy sonofa whats biting you mallory said thats just it damn it i dont quite know it just came upon me like a flash that someone said something funny  something that didnt ring true  but i cant remember what it was if i could see skipper its got him too were all going to be candidates for the straitjacket squad when we finish this trip algase smiled sourly well dont lift gravs for the next twentyfour hours thats all i ask see you later boys he turned to leave was interrupted by the buzz of the intercommunications box what again yes sparkswhat is it this time if its wilmot again tell him to go beat his brains out with a rusty bar ill see him at sparks voice was harsh with excitement it is wilmot sir but i cant tell him anything hes dead sir murdered      chandler said murdered migod captain algase said a more effective and less printable thing which ended in come on and he and chandler pounded down the runway their footsteps ringing on the jacobsladder disappearing in the distance dan mallory his thoughts chaotic sat chained to his bucket seat by the obligation of guiding the spaceship through the treacherous void his fingers played over the control keys automatically slowly the chaos left his brain and cold clear reasoning thought took its place wilmot dead why the first thought that suggested itself was norton motivejealousy the desire to get susan wilmots husband out of the way so but that was illogical norton was a skirtchaser and a quixotic fool but he wasnt a criminal murder was not in his line why else then because wilmot had been the bearer of the formula had he been slain by a spy and if so by whom lady alice was in her cabin or at leastwith a swift constriction of the throatdan hoped she was he pressed the intercommunications button hurriedly sparks face appeared before him on the visiplate get me the m13 plate sparks the one in the stateroom passageway the scene shifted aiken a space gob looked up as the audio before him glowed into life touched his forelock respectfully lieutenant mallory the prisoner is in her stateroom aye sir she hasnt been out not for a moment sir the sailor added might i ask the lootenant what the hi mean whats going on plenty snapped dan thats all sailor carry on the glow faded mallory shook his head no dice on that hunch then what else the thought came so suddenly so breathtakingly that it literally lifted him out of his chair there was but one possible answer the reverse of his former theory wilmot was neither the bearer of the precious secret nor a spy he was the innocent bystander the traditional victim who from time immemorial has always been the one to get bopped somehow the nervous jittery little man had learned who the spy was he had attempted to communicate his knowledge to captain algase the petulance of his own nature had rendered this impossible and the spy knowing that wilmot had learned his secret had again he pressed the button this time sparks said lieutenant mallory have you seen mr lemming the captain wants to question him but he cant be found anywhere never mind that rapped mallory sparks i want to know this how was wilmot killed rayed sir needled i thought as much and who was the first to find him dr bonetti sir hes being held under suspicion he confesses to having supplied wilmot with drugs sir teklinroot sir that would be thought mallory swiftly the package surreptitiously exchanged in the observation room but he claims he didnt kill wilmot quick man was captain smith anywhere around the radio turret when this happened whywhy he had been sir but he left before mr wilmot did captain algases face appeared in the visiplate beside that of sparks daniel my boy keep your eye peeled for lemming hes disappeared susan wilmot has told us he isnt a jewel merchant at all hes a jewel thief fleeing earth to gain settlers amnesty on io wilmot knew his secret tried to blackmail him lemming threatened youre after the wrong man screamed dan mallory captain i see it all now the whole story these other things have confused us sparks swiftlyget me that m13 plate again      the scene spun changed dizzily once again mallory was gazing down the corridor where aiken had stood guard but aiken no longer stood before lady alice charwells door he lay there limp still forever a smoking hole charred his broad chest crimson stirred sluggishly from the needlerays telltale trail the door of the stateroom was open a hoarse bellow told dan that the captain was seeing the same scene she did it she killed him and escaped no roared mallory smith did it the man we should have suspected all the time the man who admitted his guilt but i was too blind to see it kreuthers spy the renegade space officercaptain did you feel that his spacetrained senses had felt the swift tiny moment of jarring repercussion that meant only one thingthat from one of the escape ports a lifeskiff an auxiliary safety rocket had slipped from its base on the libra taken off into space hes escaping hes kidnaped her and taken off in a lifeskiff bud take over im lifting gravs and for the first time in his career as an officer of the ssp lieutenant daniel mallory violated deliberately a rule of the space patrol handbook he rammed the libras controls into the robot hands of the iron mike and abandoned his post in midflight      it was not that he considered himself more capable than his captain or the second mate his move was dominated by only one thing the urgent need for haste safety rockets are as everyone knows blindingly fast much faster than the heavier sturdier cruising vessels that bear them like so many unfledged wallabies in a pouch give smith a flying start and he would never be apprehended and he dan mallory was much nearer a lifeskiff port than the other officers up in the loft of the radio turret slipping skidding stumbling in his haste he raced to the nearest port flung open the controlbar threw himself into the small tearshaped vehicle lying there there were regulations demanding that air food water supplies be ascertained before flight in one of these was attempted but there was no time for such nonsense now each second seemed an hour as mallory warmed the hypatomic motors of the skiff rammed the button that opened the libras outer shell struck another that catapulted the safetyrocket away from its parent craft then the dark of the womblike casing was gone and he was blasting under his own power through space illumined with the candlegleams of a trillion galactic motes he set his rangefinder and attractorbut even as their needles found their objective his searching eyes located it a tiny silvery gleam against the tawny night aheada gleam from the stern of which flared burst upon flaming burst of superheated light the rockets of smiths skiff hellbent for io minutes had been precious vitally so already the little craft was countless thousands of miles before him it was a wide margin that separated him and in that margin lay the difference between freedom and peonage for forty thousand earthmen millions of ionians the difference between life and death for the girl smith had kidnaped the difference between victory and defeat for the solar patrolmen there was only one way to catch smith recognizing the fact dan mallory bit his lip set his jaw stubbornly acceleration acceleration great enough to fling him across the yawning void enable him to snare his quarry in tensiles and he was not strapped no safety corset to hold tight the straining cords of his viscera no yards of gauze padding to keep his wracked body from literally flinging itself to shreds no he glanced about him hurriedly there were piles of cushions soft plump airy scattered about the metallic cockpit he jammed a dozen of these behind him under him about him there was an oxyhelmet in its container beside him he thrust this over his head its rubberoid halter settled about his chest his shoulders at least his straining eyes would not bulge from their sockets by adjustmentif he could raise a handhe could compensate accelerative force with pressure he drew a deep breath then recklessly wrenched the dial of the motor to full acceleration      it was as though ten thousand fiery demons tore at his body with claws of flame a weight massive imponderable kicked the breath out of his lungs forced it from his gaping mouth and flared nostrils into the helmet he wore he gulped and strangled fighting to draw into a shrunken chest a breach of fleeing life one hand movedor tried toto his throat in an instinctive gesture of distress the hand moved a half inch from his knee flung itself back into his stomach like a leaden weight the quick burst of nausea saved his life because tortured ductless glands released a stream of adrenalin into his churning bloodstream the miraculously adaptable body of man rose once again above its normal limitations air crept into his lungs his hearts tumultuous pounding no longer throbbed a threnody in his eardrums still he could move with only the greatest of effortbut he could move and his eyes no longer blinded by the red mist that had drowned their sockets saw the rocketflares before him seem to literally stop in midflight race back toward him a great exultation seized him he was hardly aware that bright blood had burst from his nostrils and that as he opened his lips to shout hoarsely the corners of his mouth drooled red the craft he pursued whirled fiercely toward him like flameriding charioteers they jockeyed across the cosmic wastes smith knew he was there must know butmallorys grin was the grimace of a gargoylehe didnt have the guts to duplicate the young lieutenants mad burst of speed he was depending on other weapons even as mallory experienced the thought a stabbing beam spat backward from the other rocket a coruscating ray of silver that bore sudden death but mallory had anticipated the move his slow hand had been straining for seconds to forestall it he pressed a leverthe ship slid into a dive another and the terrible pressure lifted from his limbs his body felt suddenly light and buoyant strength surged back to him with singing sweetness again that stabbing ray searched for him but dan mallory was no novice at the art of space warfare he spun his craft into a cycloid laegland arc the lethal ray spent itself on indestructible space and when mallory came out of his maneuver he was within scant miles of his objective grinning savagely his hand sought the button that would smash smiths ship into oblivionthen stayed lady alice he could not destroy her with smith because now he knew certainly and surely two things one of which was that she must be the bearer of the secret ray formula to io in no other way could you account for the fact that smith had dared everything to kidnap her she carried the secret not in papers but in her mind were she to dieand might the gods of space forbid that his hand should destroy her lovelinesskreuther would still be the victor for with her would perish the final hope of the besieged new fresno garrison the other thing he realized was but there was no time for that now his fingers spurned the ray button found another a jolt shivered the spaceskiff from forequartz to rocket as his tensile beam reached across the closing miles fastened its grip on smiths craft mallorys grin tightened he cut motors his tensile beam would contract like a rubber band drawing the two ships together smith feeling that beam upon him unable to sheer it off would not be able to turn a lethal radiation upon him now for the tensile beam was a perfect conduction ray to destroy one ship meant to destroy both there was a groan behind him shocked he turned from the storage bin bleeding from nose ears mouth body twisted as though wrung through some gigantic mangler crawled the missing jewel thiefalbert lemming      mallory choked sickened lord man how did you get aboard here why liquid breath gurgled in lemmings throat glaze filmed his eyeballs tried to he panted stow away wilmot deadknew suspect mehid his head fell forward to the floor dan fingered his pulse found there not the feeblest stir of life lemming fleeing the dreaded breath of suspicion had lost the more important breath of life the miracle was that he had survived even so long the tremendous acceleration that had taxed all mallorys spacetrained protected faculties and the two spaceskiffs closed inexorably the gap between them mallorys quick brain leaped to the final problem but before he could solve it the small skiff audio burst into speech well done whoever you are said the voice from the other skiff but you realize it wont do you any good mallory rasped im coming alongside in a minute smith stand by to surrender peaceably or or mocked the exspace officer so its you lieutenant i might have guessed it your valor is exceeded only by your lack of foresight i repeat your hectic pursuit has done you no good never mind the talk stand by this is the end said mallory this is checkmate smith not checkmate my gallant young friend corrected smith stalemate true you hold me captive in your beam but to what end you cant hope to take me alive whenever i choose i can blast you and myself into atoms and with us goes he paused significantlylady alice ah you are silent lieutenant i thought you would be of course im an old man these youthful romancings no longer interest me butbless us shes much too beautiful to die isnt she lieutenant lady alices voice interrupted take him dan dont think about me im not afraid to you hear lieutenant the girls gallantry is a fit match for your own but by this time surely you have realized that if she dies the secret of the new ray weapon dies with her i think my leaders forces will have taken new fresno before a second messenger reaches io it was the truth knowing that dan mallory groaned this was a deadlock one that neither force could break he said slowly well captain what is your price for lady alices safety my own replied the renegade spaceman promptly and the secret she bears im not an unreasonable man lieutenant even though bitterness edged his wordseven though the solar space patrol did take the best years of my life squeeze the heart out of me throw my aging body into the discard like a dried pulp no im not unreasonable so that was it the selfpity of an aging man perhaps a man gone off his gravs from the letdown after active years that was why smith had renounced his ssp pledge gone over to the other side captain algases words rang in dans memory where there are new causes there are traitors to the old even a spaceman was not exempt from human weakness if lady alice will surrender her secret to me the renegade captain was continuing with convincing proof that the formula she gives me is no lie i will permit you both to live i will allow you to keep one of these ships return to safety mallory thought feverishly it was against his every scruple to parley thus with the other man but he could gain nothing by destroying himself and lady alice alive there was always a chance they might win through to the new fresno fort carry their message howsoever belated if they died kreuther and his hirelings would surely win he said very well smith i accept give him the formula lady alice her answer was tense vivid no no dan dont trust him he wont keep his promise i know he wont we must take that chance grimly tell him      the audio went dead mallory waited impatiently somewhere lost in the immensity that engulfed them the libra surged through space on a mission now in the hands of the deadlocked three so near that it was more sunlike than sol jupiter swung in its titanic orbit about mans luminary the endless night was spangled with an infinitude of stars the stars toward which man yearning gropedwhile mans feet still stumbled through the muck and mire of deceit and the audio woke to life again smiths voice was triumphant very well lieutenant i am satisfied i have finished the demolition of power and arms units in this ship its radio however still operates i think it will sustain life for you until your friends arrive i am ready to board your ship lady alices cry broke in be careful dan hell kill you he there was the sound of flesh upon flesh a silence then well lieutenant dan said come ahead you will take your place said smith in the pilots seat where i can see you from the moment i enter the lock put your hands above your head do not move or turn as i enter if you do come ahead repeated dan the audio disconnected dan sprang into motion he believed lady alices warning and he was prepared to meet subtlety with subtlety deceit with deceit not yet had smith won he bent and lifted the broken body of albert lemming hurriedly he jammed the oxyhelmet down over the dead mans bloody features he grunted sorry pal as he hoisted lemming into the pilots chair forced stiffening arms back and up in token of surrender the high back of the chair the padded cushions made the form hold its position he finished just in time there was a scraping at the airlock the two ships had drifted side to side now and entry was a simple matter mallory ducked back into the compartment from which lemming had emerged his needle gun was in his hand poised ready smith entered quietly he glanced once at the figure in the pilots chair said dont move lieutenant and his arm raised the girls warning had been all too true there was rankest treachery in the leveling of that gun in the fiery needle dart that hurled across the chamber burying itself in lemmings defenseless head the stench of charred flesh filled the room the dead body wobbled lurched to the floor and now you stand still smith gritted mallory smith whirled his jaw dropping open in his eyes dawned horror disappointment rage he cried out once raised his gun that was how he died with his traitorous fingers lifted for the last time against a man who wore the uniform he had once worn  and had disgraced      afterward as they stood in the control turret of the libra watching a soberfaced rick norton plot the landing that would bring new life to the ionian colonists swift retribution to the fomenters of the uprising bud chandler whaled his comrades back enthusiastically guy he said in words of one syllable youre terrific thats not one syllable grinned mallory all right then youre a lallapalooza but how the blue asteroids did you get onto the fact smith was the guy dan said it came to me almost too late it had been worrying me subconsciously ever since i had to here he flushedhad to arrest lady alice i knew that someone had in conversation with me said something that didnt ring true and when wilmot was killed for having discovered the truth about smith i suddenly remembered what it was the night before we got the message from lunar iii assuring us that kreuther was behind the revolution smith had mentioned to me quite casually that he suspected there were on the libra espionage agents of the kreuther forces what he was attempting to do of course was ally himself with us in order to divert suspicion but he tipped his hand by that little slip of the tongue lady alice smiled she said well youre not awfully smart any of you i knew he was the spy as soon as i heard the message from earth captain algase interrupted yeah that message im going to raise an assortment of hell about that causing us to arrest the one person on board we could really trust and all smiled the girl because of one small chemical symbol that you misread oh yes i understand now ive seen the original budyou went to the academy didnt you whywhy yes your professor there must have been quite an old man i mean your chemistry prof he was ancient but what has that got to do with it everything he taught you the old the original chemical symbol for the element samarium sa the more common symbol the generally accepted one is sm now you see what a great difference that one little error makes in the meaning of the message you read it lane warns lady alice cabal spy now on libra captain saith intensify protection of new secret ray and it should have been read broke in dan mallory understanding at last lane warns lady alice cabal spy now on libracaptain smith intensify protection and so on it was a warning to you not about you exactly naturally i waswell indignant when i was placed under arrest afterward i began to think it a good idea confined to my quarters guarded i would be completely safe but unfortunately captain smith guessed when i was arrested that i was the bearer of the formula so he killed my guard seized the skiff and kidnaped me saith grunted bud chandler disgustedly i told you that word was phony joe marlowe never used good english in his life when a cussword would do just as well hey where are you two going it is doubtful whether dan mallory heard the question there was one other little matter that needed clearing upbut soon that was the way lady alice charwell in the moment of their mutual peril had hurdled the amenities of speech addressed him not as lieutenant or even as plain mallory but as dan he said you called me dan its not right lady alice you shouldnt do things like that unless you mean them and i suppose she asked i like that part of your name best it is a nice name you know dan mallorys big hands pawed futilely at the blue of his uniform so he croaked is mallory andand i guess im completely crazy i couldnt ask you to share a name like that im just a space cop and youre a lady a titled lady she said softly a lady dan there is no duchy of io any more thats a thing of the past and my title is only a courtesy and ohim so tired of courtesies im a space cop too now theres nothing in the rules to keep two cops from teaming up is there oh you big damn dumb idiot her face smiling up at his was inclined at just the right angle they told him afterward that rick norton made a swell landing he didnt believe it for it seemed to dan mallory that the whole cosmos was swirling and dancing and twisting upside down in a delirium of delight end of
